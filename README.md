# CyberGuard

A blockchain-powered decentralized cybersecurity platform that enables secure, anonymous threat intelligence sharing, bug bounty programs, and automated reward distribution — empowering ethical hackers and organizations to collaborate against cyber threats in a transparent, tamper-proof ecosystem.

---

## Overview

CyberGuard consists of four main smart contracts that together form a decentralized, transparent, and incentivized system for cybersecurity collaboration:

1. **Guard Token Contract** – Issues and manages platform-specific utility tokens for rewards and staking.
2. **Threat Submission Contract** – Handles anonymous submissions of vulnerability reports and threat intelligence.
3. **Verification DAO Contract** – Enables community governance for verifying submissions and approving bounties.
4. **Reward Distribution Contract** – Automates the payout of rewards based on verified contributions.
